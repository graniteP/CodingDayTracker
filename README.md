# CodingDayTracker
I'm going to document the features I implement on a semi-daily schedule.

Day 0: January 21, 2026 
Today's Progress: Set up my tracking document in Github. 

Thoughts: Github is very interesting. It hosts my documents on their servers, and can be viewed by anyone. The gist of what I've learned so far, is that it's best practice to make changes in a branch (not main) via commits, then merge the changes I made in the branch to main via a pull request.
